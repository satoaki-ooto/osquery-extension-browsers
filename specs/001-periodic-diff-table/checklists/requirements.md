## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All quality checks passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

### Clarifications Resolved

1. **Timestamp Type (FR-010)**: Resolved to use wall clock time (system time) for human-readable timestamps and log correlation, accepting minimal clock adjustment risk.

## Notes

The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` (for additional refinement) or `/speckit.plan` (to begin implementation planning).
