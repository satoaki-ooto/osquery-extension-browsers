# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing browser detection system to support multi-user environments by automatically discovering and enumerating all system users, then scanning their individual browser data directories and browser history files. The current system only checks the current user's directories, but this enhancement will provide comprehensive system-wide browser detection and history access capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to detect browser installations across all users on the system, so that I can get a complete picture of browser usage across the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans for browsers THEN it SHALL enumerate all users on the system
2. WHEN a user is discovered THEN the system SHALL check their home directory for browser data directories
3. WHEN multiple users have the same browser installed THEN the system SHALL report all instances separately
4. IF a user's home directory is inaccessible THEN the system SHALL continue scanning other users without failing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically discover browser history directories for all users, so that I can analyze browser usage patterns across the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning user directories THEN the system SHALL automatically include browser history paths
2. WHEN a user has browsers installed THEN the system SHALL add their browser history directories to the paths list
3. WHEN browser history files are found THEN they SHALL be included in the discoverable browser data
4. IF browser history is not accessible for a user THEN the system SHALL skip that user's history paths without error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want a centralized function to get all system users, so that other parts of the system can leverage user enumeration functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN usersFromContext() is called THEN it SHALL return a list of all system users
2. WHEN the function encounters system errors THEN it SHALL return available users and log errors appropriately
3. WHEN running on different operating systems THEN the function SHALL use platform-appropriate user enumeration methods
4. IF no users are found THEN the function SHALL return an empty list without panicking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing FindFirefoxPaths and FindChromiumPaths functions to be enhanced with multi-user support, so that they automatically include paths from all system users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN FindFirefoxPaths() is called THEN it SHALL include Firefox paths from all system users
2. WHEN FindChromiumPaths() is called THEN it SHALL include Chromium-based browser paths from all system users
3. WHEN a user's directory is inaccessible THEN the function SHALL continue with accessible users
4. WHEN the enhanced functions are called THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing code

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want the system to handle permission errors gracefully, so that the scanning process doesn't fail when encountering restricted directories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters permission denied errors THEN it SHALL log the error and continue scanning
2. WHEN a user directory cannot be accessed THEN the system SHALL skip that user and proceed with others
3. WHEN system user enumeration fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to current user scanning
4. IF all user directories are inaccessible THEN the system SHALL return current user paths as fallback
